# Garbage classification

In this Colab notebook, I'm going to create a simple prototype of an automated garbage classifier powered by sequential neural nets. We will load a toy dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/asdasdasasdas/garbage-classification) and build on pre-trained MobileNetV2 from [TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/) collection.
